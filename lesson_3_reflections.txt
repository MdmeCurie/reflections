When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

1) if you are collaborating with other people and they need to see the work
2) you are working from multiple devices/locations and "local" is a temporary term
   
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you aren't ready for changes to be committed then an auto
pull/push would overwrite the file 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork creates a clone repository on GitHub, which can show the source or link to the
original source.  Fork is only for GitHub. Fork allows you to alter a
repository without changing the orginal, but still giving credit-link
to the original

Clone creates a copy of a repository either locally or between local
and remote.  This allows you to work on a copy of your own
repositories either because you want to do something different or in
order to work locally/remotely.

Branch is a part of the original repository, step modification in
place.  Branch works on the current repository where-ever you have it
located
